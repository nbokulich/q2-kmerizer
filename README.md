# q2-kmerizer

A [QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org) plugin for generating and working with kmers from biological sequence information.

## Installation instructions

The easiest way to install and use q2-kmerizer is to install [QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org/). q2-kmerizer has been included in the QIIME 2 distribution starting with release 2025.10. You can also install with `pip`, e.g., if you are using a custom `rachis` environment :
```
pip install q2_kmerizer@git+https://github.com/bokulich-lab/q2-kmerizer.git@main
```

To confirm that q2-kmerizer is installed in your QIIME 2/rachis environment, run the following command in your terminal:
```
qiime kmerizer --help
```


## Examples

As an example test, we will use data from [Sampson et al, 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27912057), a study testing whether the fecal microbiome contributed to the development of Parkinson’s Disease (PD).

First we will download the test data:

```
wget https://data.qiime2.org/2024.10/tutorials/pd-mice/sample_metadata.tsv
wget https://docs.qiime2.org/2024.10/data/tutorials/pd-mice/dada2_table.qza
wget https://docs.qiime2.org/2024.10/data/tutorials/pd-mice/dada2_rep_set.qza
```

We can count kmer frequencies per sample with this command:
```
qiime kmerizer seqs-to-kmers \
    --i-sequences dada2_rep_set.qza \
    --i-table dada2_table.qza \
    --o-kmer-table kmer_table.qza \
    --p-max-features 5000
```

Or run this pipeline to count kmer frequencies, calculate diversity metrics, and create an interactive scatterplot with the results:

```
qiime kmerizer core-metrics \
    --i-sequences dada2_rep_set.qza \
    --i-table dada2_table.qza \
    --p-sampling-depth 1000 \
    --m-metadata-file sample_metadata.tsv \
    --p-color-by-group donor \
    --p-max-features 5000 \
    --output-dir core-metrics/
```

Both of these actions output a frequency table that contains kmer counts per sample. This can be used like any other frequency table and passed to any action in QIIME 2 that accepts a frequency table (except for those that also require additional inputs that must match the features in the table, e.g., that require a taxonomy). For example, we can run a pipeline to train a Random Forest classifier and test on a hold-out subset of the dataset (note: this analysis is done purely for demonstrative purposes; the sample size in this test dataset is much smaller than would be required for a robust supervised learning analysis, and proper replicate handling should be done to avoid data leakage).


```
qiime sample-classifier classify-samples \
    --i-table kmer_table.qza \
    --m-metadata-file sample_metadata.tsv \
    --m-metadata-column donor \
    --output-dir sample-classifier/
```
